# A Collection of Short Python Programs

> Miscellaneous small console apps written in Python, mostly while I was learning to code. Nothing super impressive but most are quite fun and document my learning journey.

#### App Descriptions
###### Hang Man
This one is actually really fun to play. It chooses a random word from the .txt file, shows you the length by replacing each letter in the word with a * and promts you to make a guess. Each time you make a correct guess that letter will be revealed in the word, for example h*** until you guess them all and see a victory message. You have 10 lives, and if you make 10 mistakes you will see a loss message and the correct word will be revealed.
Possible future improvements: Difficulty selection to choose from shorter or longer words with more or fewer lives.
